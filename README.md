## Key Insights
- MRR is increasing due to the growth in the number of new paying users, while churn rate and revenue churn rate are also rising.
- Issues with user retention outweigh the success of acquiring new users.
- The companyâ€™s total revenue is increasing due to the growing number of paying users, rather than higher spending per user.
- The number of churned users has exceeded the number of new users since September.
- The company is losing more revenue from existing users than it gains from new users and additional purchases.
- There is a negative trend in user retention, as both user lifetime (LT) and lifetime value (LTV) have decreased during this period.
